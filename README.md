# NRF52840 Sketches

This repository contains various sketches and example codes for the **nRF52840** microcontroller, created during my study and experimentation with the board. The goal is to document working solutions and useful snippets for future reference.

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication
- Power management techniques
- Sensor interfacing (e.g., temperature, motion, etc.)
- GPIO control and peripherals usage
- USB and serial communication examples
- Custom firmware development

## ðŸ”§ Requirements
- **nRF52840 Development Board** (e.g., Nordic Semiconductor nRF52840-DK, Adafruit Feather nRF52840, etc.)
- **nRF Connect SDK** or **Arduino IDE** with nRF52 support
- Required libraries (listed in individual sketches)
